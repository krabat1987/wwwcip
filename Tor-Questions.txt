Q:
How old are you, what do you study, which career goals do you have?

A:
I am 27 years old and I study Computer Science. I'd like to keep my goals and
further wishes to myself.

Q:
If every person using or interested in Tor is tagged as being suspicious, why
should you still use Tor? Can you explain to my readers why it makes sense not
to be intimidated by these new disclosures?

A:
The data I was able to look at shows how extensive the data collection is. You
can't escape surveillance by XKeyscore or related software by not using Tor - on
the contrary, instead of the information "Mr Smith currently uses Tor" and "Some Tor
user currently watches a video on Youtube", an intelligence agency directly
reveices the information "Mr Smith currently watches a video on Youtube".

Every Tor user is sending a strong signal that he/she cares about democracy and
about the monitoring of all communication which is getting out of hand.
I can only encourage to take a stand for a free society.
