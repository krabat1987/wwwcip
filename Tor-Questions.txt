This file documents some frequently asked questions, which got asked in relation
with the surveillance of my Tor-server. The version history of this file can be

First of all: I am truly surprised, that not a single journalist has contacted
me, who has by him self proven his identity or the integrity of his
communication. I strongly ask you to consider the usage of electronic signatures
and encryption technologies. Those technologies should be essential for your 
daily work.

UPDATE: In the meantime, the first signed/encrypted emails arrive, nice!



Q:
I run a Tor-server. Am I subject of surveillance?

A:
Everybody is affected. Evidence, that the relays of all supporters of Tor are 
monitored by XKeyscore, has not come to my knowledge - the central Tor Directory
Authorities seam to be a special case.

Q: 
You are, other than Chancellor Angela Merkel, the German, who is known by
name to be subject of the surveillance. How does that feel?

A:
It is a different level of surveillance, thus I dislike this comparison. Every
German citizen is subject of surveillance on a daily basis, without anyone
mentioning it. My personal case might be good for headlines; the whole
dimension and the missing protection measures, especially for less technical
experienced people is the real scandal. I am shocked, how easily innocent
people can get into the focus of surveillance. Intelligence agency take that 
for granted.

Without playing down the spying on my server, I want to note, that I could not
find traces of further surveillance. The documents made accessible to me,
contain no evidence that, for example, my laptop, would be target of special
surveillance. Though I can not say for sure, if other parts of the huge 
XKeyscore program, could contain such evidence.
